notes: Updated the ML pipeline to use different feature sets for each model. Moved
  definition of feature sets from hardcoded to config.yaml. Also renamed models (Model
  A -> CategoryModel, Model B -> SubcategoryModel). Category model will use 2 features
  instead of 3 (we are dropping Automated Trans. Category from its features). Features
  for SubcategoryModel remains the same. This is a minor change to test model results.
  Number of labeled rows remain the same as previous version (452). Expecting mild

#Manually added notes:

#Category Model (RandomForest)
#Slight performance dip (< 0.3 pp) — practically negligible.

#Subcategory Model (Logistic Regression)
#No change
